# Parkinson_Disease_Prediction

This project/research proposes a deep transfer learning strategy that combines ensemble approaches with handwriting-based prediction.</br>

This study utilizes the NewHandPD dataset, comprising handwriting samples from individuals both with and without Parkinson's Disease (PD). Feature extraction is carried out using VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 architectures. Subsequently, a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are employed to train and evaluate the models. Additionally, ensemble methods such as Bagging with Decision Trees, Bagging with SVM, AdaBoost, and XGBoost are utilized
